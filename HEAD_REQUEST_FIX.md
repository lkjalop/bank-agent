# HEAD Request Fix for Render Health Checks

## Problem
Render was getting a `405 Method Not Allowed` error when trying to perform health checks:
```
127.0.0.1:50850 - "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed
```

## Root Cause
- Render's load balancer uses HEAD requests for health checks
- Your FastAPI root endpoint (`/`) only supported GET requests
- HEAD requests are HTTP requests that return only headers (no body) and are commonly used by load balancers to check if a service is alive

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added HEAD Request Support to Root Endpoint
```python
@app.get("/")
@app.head("/")
def root():
    """Root endpoint - health check (supports both GET and HEAD requests)"""
    return {
        "message": "Bank Account Agent is running!",
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

### 2. Added Dedicated Health Check Endpoint
```python
@app.get("/health")
@app.head("/health") 
def health_check():
    """Dedicated health check endpoint for load balancers"""
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

## How It Works

- **GET requests** to `/` return the full JSON response with message, status, and timestamp
- **HEAD requests** to `/` return only the HTTP headers with a 200 status code (no body)
- Both `/` and `/health` endpoints now support both GET and HEAD methods
- Render's health checks will now succeed with a 200 OK response

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Fixes Render deployment issue** - No more 405 errors
2. ✅ **Maintains backward compatibility** - GET requests still work exactly the same
3. ✅ **Follows web standards** - HEAD requests are standard for health checks
4. ✅ **Provides dedicated health endpoint** - `/health` for monitoring systems
5. ✅ **Better monitoring** - Load balancers can efficiently check service health

## Expected Behavior After Fix

Instead of:
```
127.0.0.1:50850 - "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed
```

You should now see:
```
127.0.0.1:50850 - "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

## Testing

You can test the fix locally:
```bash
# Test GET request (returns JSON)
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Test HEAD request (returns only headers)
curl -I http://localhost:8000/

# Test dedicated health endpoint
curl -I http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Files Updated
- `main.py` - Added `@app.head("/")` decorator and `/health` endpoint

This fix ensures your FastAPI application properly handles Render's health check requests and should resolve the deployment issue!
