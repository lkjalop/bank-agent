# Render Deployment Fix - Port Binding Issue

## Problem Analysis
The deployment was failing because:
1. Render was running `uvicorn main:app --reload` instead of the command in `render.yaml`
2. The `--reload` flag causes uvicorn to bind to `127.0.0.1:8000` instead of `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
3. Render couldn't detect an open port on `0.0.0.0`

## Root Cause
- The `--reload` flag is for development only and overrides host/port settings
- Render's auto-detection was potentially ignoring the `render.yaml` configuration
- The server was binding to localhost instead of all interfaces

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed render.yaml Configuration
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: bank-agent
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: python run_server.py
```

### 2. Created Dedicated Startup Script (run_server.py)
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import uvicorn
from main import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 10000))
    print(f"ðŸš€ Starting FastAPI Bank Account Agent on 0.0.0.0:{port}")
    print(f"Environment PORT: {os.environ.get('PORT', 'Not set')}")
    
    uvicorn.run(
        app,
        host="0.0.0.0",
        port=port,
        log_level="info",
        access_log=True
    )
```

### 3. Enhanced main.py Port Handling
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
    print(f"Starting server on 0.0.0.0:{port}")
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

### 4. Alternative Startup Script (start.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting FastAPI Bank Account Agent..."
echo "PORT environment variable: $PORT"
echo "Starting uvicorn with host 0.0.0.0 and port $PORT"
exec uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 1
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed `--reload` flag** - This was causing the binding issue
2. **Created explicit startup script** - `run_server.py` for better control
3. **Added debugging output** - To see what port is being used
4. **Used Python module execution** - More reliable than direct uvicorn command
5. **Added proper error handling** - Better logging and debugging

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. âœ… Server binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (where $PORT is Render's assigned port)
2. âœ… Render detects the open port successfully
3. âœ… No more "No open ports detected" errors
4. âœ… Application becomes accessible at your Render URL
5. âœ… Proper logging shows the correct host and port

## Files Updated
- `render.yaml` - Fixed startCommand
- `main.py` - Enhanced port handling with debugging
- `run_server.py` - NEW: Dedicated startup script
- `start.sh` - NEW: Alternative bash startup script

## Testing the Fix
After Render redeploys, you should see logs like:
```
ðŸš€ Starting FastAPI Bank Account Agent on 0.0.0.0:10000
Environment PORT: 10000
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:10000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Instead of:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Next Steps
1. Render will auto-redeploy with the new configuration
2. Check the deployment logs for the corrected output
3. Test your endpoints once deployment completes
4. Your app should be accessible at: `https://bank-agent.onrender.com`

This fix ensures proper port binding for Render's infrastructure while maintaining local development compatibility.
